## Motivation

The frontend part of the project is part of [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). The backend was added to persist data.

## Technologies

An updated version using RTK Query is currently being developed on the rtk-query branch.

## Installation Instructions

```

In a separate terminal tab:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/HannaEb/would-you-rather.git

```

You can now see the app in your browser.
